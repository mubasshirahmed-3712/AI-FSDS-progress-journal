# 🏥 Healthcare EDA – Heart Disease Risk Analysis

Welcome to the **Healthcare EDA Project**, where we perform a professional **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a real-world **Heart Disease dataset**. This analysis aims to uncover patterns and feature relationships that help predict heart disease risk.

## 📊 Project Overview

This repository includes:

- ✅ Real-world **data cleaning** and preprocessing (null check, duplicates)
- ✅ Univariate and Bivariate **visualizations** (histograms, scatterplots, heatmaps)
- ✅ Statistical insights for **predictive modeling readiness**
- ✅ Domain: Healthcare (Cardiology)

## 📌 Key Insights Derived

- Patients aged **45–65** are most frequent in the dataset.
- **Chest pain type**, **max heart rate**, and **ST depression** are strongly correlated with heart disease.
- Dataset is cleaned and suitable for **machine learning modeling**.
