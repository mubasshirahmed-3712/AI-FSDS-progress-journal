# 🌸 IrisViz – Matplotlib & Seaborn Mastery

A complete data visualization journey through the **Iris Dataset** using **33+ Matplotlib and Seaborn plots**. This project serves as a **professional-grade guide** for mastering visual analytics and storytelling with Python.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This notebook demonstrates how to effectively visualize **numerical and categorical features** in the Iris dataset using:
- ✅ **Matplotlib** – for fine-tuned custom plots
- ✅ **Seaborn** – for statistical and advanced plots

Each plot is **accompanied by comments, insights, and styling best practices**, tailored for **Data Science portfolios** and **interviews**.
